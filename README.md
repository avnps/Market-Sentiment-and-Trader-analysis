# Market-Sentiment-and-Trader-Performance-analysis



### Description:
This project analyzes the relationship between market sentiment (as measured by the Fear & Greed Index) and trader performance using historical trading data. The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, and statistical insights to understand how different market sentiment classifications (Extreme Fear, Fear, Neutral, Greed, Extreme Greed) correlate with trader profitability metrics.

Key features of the project:
- Data processing and merging of Fear & Greed Index data with trader performance metrics
- Visualization of sentiment distribution and its impact on trader PnL (Profit and Loss)
- Statistical analysis of trader performance across different sentiment categories
- Daily aggregation of trading metrics and sentiment classification

The project is implemented in Python using popular data science libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy. The visualizations provide clear insights into how market sentiment affects trading outcomes, with box plots showing the distribution of total and mean PnL across different sentiment categories.

This analysis can help traders and investors understand market dynamics and potentially improve trading strategies based on market sentiment indicators.
